# merge_vars: An action plugin for Ansible

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leapfrogonline/ansible-merge-vars.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leapfrogonline/ansible-merge-vars)

An Ansible plugin to merge all variables in context with a certain suffix (lists
or dicts only) and create a new variable that contains the result of this merge.
This is an Ansible action plugin, which is basically an Ansible module that runs
on the machine running Ansible rather than on the host that Ansible is
provisioning.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Ansible version >= 2.1.0.0

## Installation

By default, Ansible will look for action plugins in an `action_plugins` folder
adjacent to the running playbook. For more information on this, or to change the
location where ansible looks for action plugins,
see
[the Ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/dev_guide/developing_plugins.html#distributing-plugins).

Ansible action plugins are usually paired with modules (which run on the hosts being provisioned), and Ansible will automatically run an action plugin when you call of a module of the same name in a task.  Since we want to be able to call this action plugin by its name (`merge_vars`) in our tasks, we need an empty file called `merge_vars` in the place where ansible checks for custom modules; by default, this is a `library` directory adjacent to the running playbook.

So, from the root of your Ansible playbook repository:

1. Create the `action_plugins` directory if it's not created yet:

   ```
   mkdir -p action_plugins
   ```

1. Copy the [merge_vars.py](merge_vars.py) file to your `action_plugins` directory.
1. Create the `library` directory if it's not created yet:

   ```
   mkdir -p library
   ```
    
1. Create an empty `merge_vars` file in your `library` directory:

    ```
    touch library/merge_vars
    ```

## Usage

The variables that you want to merge must be suffixed with `__to_merge`.
They can be defined anywhere in the inventory, or by any other means; as long
as they're in the context for the running play, they'll be merged.

### Merging dicts

Let's say we've got a group `someenvironment` in `group_vars` with a file
`users.yml`, with these contents:

```yaml
users__someenvironment_users__to_merge:
  user1: bob
  user2: henry
```

and a group `somedatacenter` in `groups_vars` with a file `users.yml`, with these
contents:

```yaml
users__somedatacenter_users__to_merge:
  user3: sally
  user4: jane
```

and we're running a play against hosts that are in both of those groups.
Then this task:

```yaml
name: Merge user vars
merge_vars:
  suffix_to_merge: users__to_merge
  merged_var_name: merged_users
  expected_type: 'dict'
```
will set a `merged_users` var (fact) available to all subsequent tasks that looks like this (if it were to be declared in raw yaml):

```yaml
merged_users:
  user1: bob
  user2: henry
  user3: sally
  user4: jane
```

Note that the order in which the dicts get merged is non-deterministic. So this setup:

```yaml
users__someenvironment_users__to_merge:
  user1: bob
  user2: jekyll
```

```yaml
users__somedatacenter_users__to_merge:
  user2: hyde
  user3: sally
```

```yaml
name: Merge user vars
merge_vars:
  suffix_to_merge: users__to_merge
  merged_var_name: merged_users
  expected_type: 'dict'
```

could set a `merged_users` var that looks like this (if it were to be declared in raw yaml:

```yaml
merged_users:
  user1: bob
  user2: jekyll
  user3: sally
```

*OR* this:

```yaml
merged_users:
  user1: bob
  user2: hyde
  user3: sally
```

With great power comes great responsibility...

### Merging lists

Let's say we've got a `someenvironment` group with an `open_ports.yml` file
that looks like this:

```yaml
open_ports__someenvironment_open_ports__to_merge:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
```
and a `somedatacenter group with an `open_ports.yml` file that looks like this:

```yaml
open_ports__somedatacenter_open_ports__to_merge:
  - 3
  - 4
  - 5
```
Then this task:

```yaml
name: Merge open ports
merge_vars:
  suffix_to_merge: open_ports__to_merge
  merged_var_name: merged_ports
  expected_type: 'list'
```
will set a `merged_ports` fact that looks like this:

```yaml
merged_ports:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
  - 4
  - 5
```

*OR* this; remember, the order in which variables get merged is non-deterministic:

```yaml
merged_ports:
  - 3
  - 4
  - 5
  - 1
  - 2
```

Notice that `3` only appears once in the merged result. By default, this
`merge_vars` plugin will de-dupe the resulting merged value. If you don't want
to de-dupe the merged value, you have to declare the `dedup` argument:

```yaml
name: Merge open ports
merge_vars:
  suffix_to_merge: open_ports__to_merge
  merged_var_name: merged_ports
  dedup: false
  expected_type: 'list'
```
which will set this fact (or some permutation thereof):

```yaml
merged_ports:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
  - 3
  - 4
  - 5
```

A note about `dedup`:
  * It has no effect when the merged vars are dictionaries.

## Verbosity

Running ansible-playbook with `-v` will cause this plugin to output the order in
which the keys are being merged:

```
PLAY [Example of merging lists] ************************************************

TASK [Merge port vars] *********************************************************
Merging vars in this order: [u'group2_ports__to_merge', u'group3_ports__to_merge', u'group1_ports__to_merge']
ok: [localhost] => {"ansible_facts": {"merged_ports": [22, 1111, 443, 2222, 80]}, "changed": false}

## Example Playbooks

There are some example playbooks in the [examples folder](examples) in this
repository. Prerequisites:

  1. You have python 2.7 installed and a `python2.7` executable is on your path.
  1. You have the virtualenv tool installed and a `virtualenv` executable on
     your path.
 
To run all of the example playbooks (from the root of this repository):

    make examples

This will create a virtualenv, install the relevant dependencies into it, and
run each example playbook using the `ansible-playbook` executable in the
virtualenv.

To run a single example, assuming you have your virtualenv and dependencies that
the above make command generates:

    env/bin/ansible-playbook examples/merge_lists_playbook.yml

These are the only prerequisites to working on this project locally:

  1. You have python 2.7 installed and a `python2.7` executable is on your path.

If you have any ideas about things to add or improve, or find any bugs to fix, we're all ears!  Just a few guidelines:

  1. Please write or update tests (either example-based tests, property-based
     tests, or both) for any code that you add, change, or remove.
  
     To run the example-based and property-based tests, run `make test` from the
     root of this repository.
     
  1. Please make sure that `make test-all` exits zero. This runs a code linter,
     all of the tests, and all of the examples.
  
  1. If the linting seems too annoying, it probably is! Feel free to do what you
     need to do in the `.pylintrc` at the root of this repository to maintain
     sanity. Add it to your PR, and we'll most likely take it.

Happy merging!
